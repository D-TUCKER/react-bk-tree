# Downshift BK Tree Exploration

### Using a [BK Tree](https://signal-to-noise.xyz/post/bk-tree/) to filter input on a [Downshift](https://github.com/paypal/downshift) input.

* run yarn or 'npm install' then 'yarn start' or 'npm start' to get things going.

* Change the distance select to make the search more or less forgiving.

* The Data is from a big list of 5000 or so names that I found on the internet. 

* The BK tree implementation is in the src/bkTree folder and the downshift select is in src/downshift.
